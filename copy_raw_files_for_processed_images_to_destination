<#
    This script will open the folder that has all the processed images(processed images = photoshop file format)
    and iterate through the files it finds in that folder
    For each file we find, we will copy the original raw image to a new folder called: destination
    This can be handy if a request came in to retrieve the unprocessed images from a published project.
    Instead of having to sift through hundreds of unpublished raw images, we can get the raw images for the processed/published images.
